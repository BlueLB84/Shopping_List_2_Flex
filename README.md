# Shopping_List_2_Flex
Thinkful Flex - Second, Guided Shopping List App Challenge

This is a simple shopping list app.  I am following along with Thinkful's Flex Web Dev bootcamp.

This lesson teaches about using User Stories to set up the purpose and function of the app.  The lesson also helps the student avoid "spaghetti" code but first setting up function stubs and coding intentionally with smaller, single-use functions.  The functions are also given appropriate names that provide a quick glance for anyone to see what their main purpose is.
